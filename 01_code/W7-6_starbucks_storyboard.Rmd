### Starbucks is a Seattle Institution

<div style="text-align: center"> <font size="10"> Starbucks is a Seattle Institution </div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center"> ![](star4.jpg) </div>

### Where was the original Starbucks, zoom and see!

```{r}
# Map coordinates of the first Starbucks, leaflet does the rest
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng = -122.3435, lat = 47.6106,  
             popup="The first Starbucks opened in 1971") %>% 
  setView(lng = -122.3435, lat = 47.6106, zoom = 17)

```

***
```{r}
# The three *** above create a panel for text
```


The map is from the [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) package

- It is an htmlwidget package

- Interactive panning/zooming

- Compose maps using arbitrary combinations of map tiles, markers, polygons, lines, popups, and GeoJSON

- Create maps right from the R console or RStudio

- Embed maps in knitr/R Markdown documents and Shiny apps

- Use map bounds and mouse events to drive Shiny logic


### Are there other Starbucks near by??

+ Zoom out to see other Starbucks in Seattle

```{r}
# Load data on all the US starbucks locations
# Got the data from http://www.compciv.org/files/datadumps/practicum/us-starbucks-distant.csv
starbucks <- read.csv("starbucks.csv")

```

```{r}
# Show just the Seattle Starbucks 
starbucks %>% 
  filter(City == "Seattle") %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
    addTiles() %>% 
    addMarkers(lng = -122.3435, lat = 47.6106, 
               popup = "The first Starbucks") %>% 
    addMarkers(~Longitude, ~Latitude, label = ~as.character(Name)) %>% 
    setView(lng = -122.3435, lat = 47.6106, zoom = 18)

```


### How many Starbucks there are in the US??

+ Yikes, the data set indicates there are `r dim(starbucks)[1]` Starbucks in the US

```{r}
# Show all Starbucks in the US
starbucks %>%
  leaflet() %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(~Longitude, ~Latitude, label = ~as.character(Name))

```


### How are Starbucks stores distributed by state?? Show the distribution with a choropleth, i.e. map colored by a measure.



```{r}
# Convert state abbreviation to state name
starbucks$state <- setNames(state.name, state.abb)[starbucks$Country.Subdivision]

# Convert state to all lower cases to match map_data and calculate how many SB per state
starb_map <- starbucks %>% 
  mutate(region = str_to_lower(state)) %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
#  filter(region != "alaska", region != "hawaii") %>% 
  summarise(n = n())  

# Map the number of starbucks per state with choropleth
map_data("state") %>% 
  left_join(starb_map, by = "region") %>%  # Join by region, which is state
  arrange(group, order) %>%  # Order so draws correctly
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = n)) +
    geom_polygon(color = "black") +
    theme_void() +
    scale_fill_continuous(name = "Number of\nStarbucks", 
                          low = "light blue", high = "navy") + # Adjust fill color
    coord_fixed(1.4)

```

### How are Starbucks stores distributed **per capita** by state??

+ Whoa, look at North Dakota and West Virgina!

```{r}
# 2019 population estimate from http://worldpopulationreview.com/states/
pop <- read.csv("us_pop_data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(region = str_to_lower(State))

map_data("state") %>% 
  left_join(starb_map, by = "region") %>%  # Join by region, which is state
  left_join(pop, by = "region") %>%  # Join by region, which is state
  mutate(n = n/Pop*1000000) %>% # Starbucks per million people
  arrange(group, order) %>%  # Order so draws correctly
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = n)) +
    geom_polygon(color = "black") +
    theme_void() +
    scale_fill_continuous(name = "Number of\nStarbucks\nper Million\nPeople", 
                          low = "light blue", high = "navy") + # Adjust fill color
